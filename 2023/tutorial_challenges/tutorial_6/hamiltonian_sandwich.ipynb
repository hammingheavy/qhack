    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you must complete two functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `hamiltonian`: responsible for creating the Hamiltonian in question for a general number of qubits (`num_wires`). **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " - `expectation_value`: simulates the circuit in question and returns the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in question. **You must complete this function** by creating a QNode within this function that returns the expectation value of the Hamiltonian. \n",
    " \n",
    " Here are some helpful resources and hints:\n",
    " \n",
    " - The $X_i X_j$ term, mathematically, denotes a *tensor product* between the two Pauli-X operators. Here are some ways you can perform this in PennyLane:\n",
    "   + use the `@` operator to take the tensor product between operators;\n",
    "   + use [`qml.prod`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.prod.html).\n",
    " - [`qml.Hamiltonian`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.Hamiltonian.html)\n",
    " - [Operator arithmetic](https://pennylane.ai/blog/2022/08/pennylane-v025-released/#intuitive-operator-arithmetic)\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given the number of qubits $n$, `num_wires` (`int`).\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (`float`).\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
