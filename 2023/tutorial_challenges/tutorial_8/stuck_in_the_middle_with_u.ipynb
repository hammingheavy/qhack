    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given a function called `circuit`. **You must complete \n",
    " this function** by constructing the following four-qubit circuit:\n",
    " \n",
    " <p align=\"center\">\n",
    " <img src=\"./images/daily8.png\" width=\"650\"/>\n",
    " </p>\n",
    " \n",
    " The circuit has a Hadamard gate on every qubit, an $R_x$ gate, a couple of \n",
    " CNOTs, and then the mid-circuit measurements. Note here that the measurements happen \n",
    " on the first and third qubits, and that the [`qml.U3`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.U3.html) gate is only applied to the \n",
    " fourth qubit if the following condition is met upon measuring the first and third \n",
    " wires: $m_0 + m_2 \\geq 1$ (i.e. at least one of them is $1$). The last operator, `qml.PauliZ` on the fourth qubit, is \n",
    " applied regardless.\n",
    " \n",
    " The [`qml.measure`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.measure.html) \n",
    " function should be helpful to you!\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `angles` (`list(float)`): a list of angles containing $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, and $\\theta_3$ in that order. Use this to create the circuit!\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output a `numpy.tensor` containing  the probabilities associated to a computational basis measurement **on the fourth qubit.**\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
