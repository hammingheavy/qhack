    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you must complete the following functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `three_optimization_steps`: performs three optimization steps. **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " - `cost`: this is within the `three_optimization_steps` function. **You must complete this function**. `cost` is a QNode that does a few things:\n",
    "   + acts on 3 qubits only;\n",
    "   + embeds the input `data` via [amplitude embedding](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.AmplitudeEmbedding.html);\n",
    "   + defines some differentiable gates via a template called [qml.BasicEntanglerLayers](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.BasicEntanglerLayers.html); and\n",
    "   + returns the expectation value of $\\sum_{i = 1}^n Z_i$, where $n$ is the number of qubits.\n",
    " \n",
    " Within the `three_optimization_steps` function is a variable called `weights`. These are the changeable parameters that help define the `qml.BasicEntanglerLayers` template that you must put in the `cost` function. `weights` are the parameters that will be optimized (and need to be referred to by this name due to the final call `return cost(weights, data=data)`, which cannot be edited).\n",
    " \n",
    " To perform three optimization steps, use a gradient decent optimizer — `qml.GradientDescentOptimizer` — with a step size of $0.01$.\n",
    " \n",
    " Here are some helpful resources:\n",
    " \n",
    " - [Optimizing a quantum circuit — YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TiQ7T1h8VAQ)\n",
    " - [Basic tutorial: qubit rotation — Optimization](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html#optimization)\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given classical `data` (`list(float)`) that you must embed into a quantum circuit via [amplitude embedding](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.AmplitudeEmbedding.html).\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output the evaluation of `cost` after three optimization steps have been performed.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
