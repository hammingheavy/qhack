    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given a few functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `hydrogen_hamiltonian`: This function will return the qubit Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule, H$_2$, given the `coordinates` of both hydrogen atoms and the net molecular `charge`. You'll usually find H$_2$ with a charge of 0, but here we'll spice it up with a non-zero charge!\n",
    " - `num_electrons`: In subsequent functions, we'll need the total number of electrons in the hydrogen molecule we're looking at. With a charge of 0, H$_2$ usually has just 2 electrons, one per hydrogen atom. Given the `charge`, how many electrons should H$_2$ have? ***You must complete this function.***\n",
    " - `hf`: The \"HF\" stands for Hartree–Fock. This function's purpose is calculate the HF approximation — treat every electron as independent, electrons move under a Coulomb potential from the positively charged nuclei, and there's a mean field from the other electrons — for the ground state of the hydrogen molecule we're interested in. We'll use this later, so ***you must complete this function.***\n",
    " - `run_VQE`: This function takes the `coordinates`, `charge`, generates the HF state, defines a `cost` function and minimizes it. ***You must complete this function*** by:\n",
    "   + defining the gates within the `cost` function, using the [`qml.AllSinglesDoubles`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.AllSinglesDoubles.html) template with `singles` and `doubles` arguments defined below; and\n",
    "   + returning what we want to minimize, namely the expectation value of the hydrogen Hamiltonian! \n",
    " \n",
    " Here are some helpful resources:\n",
    " \n",
    " - [Building molecular Hamiltonians](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_chemistry.html)\n",
    " - [A brief overview of VQE](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html)\n",

    " \n",
    " ### Input \n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `coordinates` (`list(float)`): the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates of each hydrogen atom\n",
    " - `charge` (`int`): the charge of the hydrogen molecule. It could be positive, negative, or zero!\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code must output the ground state `energy` (`float`) of the hydrogen molecule in question.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-3` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
