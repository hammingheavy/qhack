Welcome to the QHack 2023 tutorial challenges! These challenges are worth no points — they are specifically designed to get your brain active and into the right mindset for the competition. You will also learn about various aspects of PennyLane that are essential to quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and quantum chemistry. Have fun!

### Tutorial \# 1 — Adding two numbers

By completing this tutorial problem, you will gain confidence with interacting with this interface for submitting solutions to the challenges. 

The code intentionally contains editable sections as well as non-editable sections to ensure that vital pieces of the entire code are not modified — they are essential to evaluating your solution. Within the editable sections, you must write your solution to the given problem. Your solution will run against `test_cases`. 

## Challenge code

In the notebook `it_adds_up.ipynb`, you are given a function called `add_numbers`. **You must complete this function**.

### Input 

As input to this problem, you are given a `list(float)` containing two numbers to add together: `x` and `y`.

### Output

This code must output `x + y` (`float`).

If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `"Correct!"` Otherwise, you will receive a `"Wrong answer"` prompt.

Good luck and have fun with all of the coding challenges!
