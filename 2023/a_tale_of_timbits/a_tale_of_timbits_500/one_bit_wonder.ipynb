    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given a few functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `calculate_timbit`: This function will return a timbit associated to the operator $U$ and input state $\\rho_0$, given an initial guess  $\\rho$ for the timbit. It returns the density matrix representation of the timbit $\\rho^{*}.$ **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " - `apply_timbit_gate`:  Returns the output density matrix after applying a timbit gate to a state $\\rho_0$.\n",
    "     The input and output density matrices are associated with the first qubit.\n",
    " - `SAT`: uses a timbit gate to solve the\n",
    "   satisfiability problem for an arbitrary Boolean function $f$ (on\n",
    "   `n_bits` bits) with an oracle in matrix form `U_f`, using `q` timbit gates, and `rho` being the initial guess for the NP fixed point. The output should be the computational basis measurement probabilities for the last qubit, which should be `[1. , 0.]` if and only if there are no elements $x$ such that $f(x) =1.$ **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Inputs\n",
    " \n",
    " As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `q (int)`: the number of times the timbit gate is applied to solve the SAT problem.\n",
    " \n",
    " Additionally, you are given the following global variables:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `U_f array(array(float))`:  the oracle $U_f$ we will use to test your solution in matrix form.\n",
    " - `U_NP array(array(float))`: the gate $U_{\\textsf{NP}}$ as defined above.\n",
    " - `rho (array(array(float))`: the initial guess for the stationary state of the timbit gate $\\textsf{T}_{\\textsf{NP}}.$\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " The output for this challenge corresponds to the output of your `SAT` function. It should produce a `numpy.tensor` of length 2 corresponding to the measurement probabilities in the computational basis for the qubit on which the timbit gates are applied.\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
