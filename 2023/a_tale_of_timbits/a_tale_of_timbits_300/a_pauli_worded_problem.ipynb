    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given various functions:\n",
    " - `word_dist`: which counts the number of non-identity operators in a\n",
    "   Pauli word.\n",
    " - `abs_dist`: which computes the distance $\\vert \\rho - \\sigma \\vert$ between density matrices (`rho` and `sigma`).\n",
    " - `noisy_Pauli_density`: a helper subcircuit which produces the density matrix $\\rho_P$\n",
    "   associated with a Pauli word $P$ (`word`) and applies depolarizing\n",
    "   noise to each qubit with parameter `lmbda`. It is merely a\n",
    "   collection of gates, and should not return anything. **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " - `maxmix_trace_dist`: a helper function which calculates the trace distance\n",
    "   $T(\\rho_P(\\lambda), \\rho_0)$, from the noisy\n",
    "   $\\rho_Q$ (specified by `word` and `lmbda`) to the maximally mixed\n",
    "   density $\\rho_0.$ **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " - `bound_verifier`: a function which computes the difference\n",
    " $$(1-\\lambda)^{|P|} - T(\\rho_P(\\lambda), \\rho_0),$$ with both terms specified by `lmbda` and `P`. **You must complete this function**.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Inputs\n",
    " \n",
    " The functions `noisy_Pauli_density`, `maxmix_trace_dist` and `bound_verifier` take as input a\n",
    " Pauli word  (`word (str)`) represented as a string of characters `I`,\n",
    " `X`, `Y` and `Z`, and a noise parameter `lmbda (float)` giving\n",
    " probability of erasing the state of a qubit.\n",
    " \n",
    " Note that, for `noisy_Pauli_density`, you are working with the\n",
    " `default.mixed` device and can create a density matrix using\n",
    " [`qml.QubitDensityMatrix`](https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.QubitDensityMatrix.html).\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " Your function `bound_verifier` must correctly compute the difference between the upper bound $(1 - \\lambda)^{|P|}$ and the trace distance $T(\\rho_P(\\lambda), \\rho_0)$ on test cases.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance\n",
    " specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error\n",
    " tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will\n",
    " receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
