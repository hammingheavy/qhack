    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In the code below, you are given a few functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `bell_prearation`: creates the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0000\\rangle + |1111\\rangle).$ This gate will act on the first 3 robots and the hub â€” `hub`, `robot1`, `robot2`, and `robot3`. **You must complete this function.**\n",
    " - `emergency_gate_U`: the gate, $U$, that somehow manages to save the total state after one of the robots is threatened and its qubit collapses. It will act only on one qubit. **You must complete this function.** \n",
    " - `setting_new_robot`: takes care of defining a new auxiliary robot configuration. It will only act on the `hub` and `auxiliary_robot` qubits. **You must complete this function.**\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Input\n",
    " \n",
    " In this challenge, there is no input. Our grader will simply check that the final state of the `hub`, `robot2`, `robot3`, and `auxiliary_robot` qubits is correct.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " This code will output the density matrix (`numpy.tensor`) of the `hub`, `robot2`, `robot3`, and `auxiliary_robot` system. \n",
    " \n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case, it's a relative tolerance of `1e-5`), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " Good luck!\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
