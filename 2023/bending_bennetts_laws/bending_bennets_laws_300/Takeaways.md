- Instread of creating a variational circuit (a good idea by the way), create a linspace of thetas and sweep over it to find if the required conditions hold
- To multiply two or more operators use the @ symbol (!!) (no need for kron)
- Using qml.expval I can calculate the expectation value of any operator (need not be hermitian) but make sure that the product inside has been multiplied with @'s 
- Need not create a quantum node everytime, need to learn where to create one and where it is not needed
- I can calculate the transpose of a matrix in np using .T
