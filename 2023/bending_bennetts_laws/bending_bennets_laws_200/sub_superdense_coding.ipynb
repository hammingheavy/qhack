    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " You simply have to complete two quantum functions:\n",
    " \n",
    " - `encode`: quantum function that will define an operator to be applied only on Zenda's qubits. This function will depend on the bits $(i,j,k)$ to be encoded.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - `decode`: quantum function that defines the operator that Reece will use to retrieve the bits that Zenda sent. In this case, the operator does not have any information about Zenda's bits, so the same operators will always be applied regardless of the state that Zenda sends Reece.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Output\n",
    " \n",
    " In this challenge, we will not judge your solution using public or private test cases. Instead, we will check that, for all combinations of $i$, $j$, and $k$, the entire encoding and decoding circuit behaves as expected.\n",
