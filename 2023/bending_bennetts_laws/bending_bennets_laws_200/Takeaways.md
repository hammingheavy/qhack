- Bell basis $\rightarrow$ 2 qubits
- Analogous to bell basis, for three qubits GHZ states/basis
- To encode a state, run the final state thorogh the decoder in reverse and see what state must go in to get the final state
- I can reverse the order of the terms in the quantum states cotaining a sum of terms to manipulate my state
