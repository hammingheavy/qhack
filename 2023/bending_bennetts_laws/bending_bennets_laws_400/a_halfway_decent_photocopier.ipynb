    "## Challenge code\n",
    " \n",
    " In this challenge, you will be asked to complete the `zenda_operator`, `copier`and `printer` functions. All of them are quantum functions where you will only have to place the necessary gates.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Inputs\n",
    " \n",
    " The inputs of this challenge correspond to the three coefficients of a $U3$ gate in charge of encoding the state $|\\Phi\\rangle$ that Zenda wants to send.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Outputs\n",
    " To check the solution, we will calculate the expected value with respect to a particular observable to see that it coincides with the same one generated by Zenda.\n",
    " If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance\n",
    " specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-2` absolute error\n",
    " tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"` Otherwise, you will\n",
    " receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt.\n",
    " ### Imports\n",
    " The cell below specifies the libraries you should use in this challenge. Run the cell to import the libraries. ***Do not modify the cell.***"
